# ksp-autopilot
Autopilot for autonomous recoverable booster in Kerbal Space Program.
Written in python using KRPC to interface Kerbal Space Program.
Still really rough around the edges and can only do a simple demonstration flight with the provieded craft.
Flies the rocket up to 8000 meters, decouples the second stage, flips the rocket around, boosts back to the launch pad, glides back, and lands.
